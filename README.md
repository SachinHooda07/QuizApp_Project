Quiz App :- 

I created an interactive quiz app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to test users' knowledge on various topics. The app features a responsive user interface with multiple-choice questions, a real-time scoring system, and instant feedback for each answer. Users can navigate through the quiz seamlessly, and the app dynamically tracks their progress. This project enhanced my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, and responsive design, showcasing my ability to build engaging and functional web applications.

Key Features:-

1. User Interface:

   - Design a responsive and user-friendly interface using HTML and CSS.
   - Implement various styling elements to enhance the visual appeal of the app.

2. Question and Answer Logic:

   - Use JavaScript to manage the quiz logic, including displaying questions, accepting user inputs, and providing feedback.

3. Scoring System:

   - Develop a scoring mechanism to track user performance throughout the quiz.

4. Timer Functionality:

   - Implement a countdown timer for each question to increase the challenge.
   - Handle timer expiration and update the user interface accordingly.

Technologies Used:-

- HTML: Structure the quiz application and its components.
- CSS: Style the quiz application for an attractive and responsive design.
- JavaScript: Implement the core functionality, including question logic, user interaction, and dynamic content updates.
